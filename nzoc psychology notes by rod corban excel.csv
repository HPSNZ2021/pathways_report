He acknowledges feeling worse since the last session, attributing this decline to the sinking reality of his relationship's future.

- Client and Rod will schedule another session to follow up on the client's progress in setting boundaries, managing his emotional responses, and the impact of potential use of sleeping aids on his well-being.
