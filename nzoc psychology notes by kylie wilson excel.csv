Moira did not engage with any formal psyche support with the psyche team during her time in the village.
She was engaging in team spaces and appeared relaxed and happy.
Post-competition, because of the controversial nature of the result, she was regularly observed talking about the judging decision (likely because she was asked) but this lasted for a few days - so my assumption - which i acknowledge is dangerous - will be that she might need some support processing what happened to allow her to move forward.

Transition
Tenika - struggled with the role as 14th, did a superb job at supporting the team and enjoyed the experience but will require support from both of us.  Is moving to play league but a follow-up post-games would be valuable.  I believe this will assist her to transition to rugby league effectively and help her if she returns to the program.
Tysha - as above, unclear on contracting position (you might know more), a follow-up with her to support transition would be helpful.
Portia & Tyla - retiring from 7s so we need to initiate a transition support plan.  I will check in with both at the end of games to remind them I am still available, but predict you will lead the transition support for them.
Mahina - might require additional support to process lack of playing time which i will lead on, be good for you to check in with her though.  

Staff 
I am keen to understand what support we are putting around those staff members impacted by the recruitment process (Jess, Kate, Murph).  Dom - Can you please update?

She was in a good headspace, knew she had access to key support (yourself and psyche in the UK, both of whom she said were game changes for her) and was planning on accessing you both.  Overall she seemed ok with her experience but was motivated to get better.

- preparation good and generally happy and engaged
- due to covid in NZ Village, she volunteered to move out to stay in her day house, so was out of the village during competition period - this was positive as Brendan was able to stay with her so felt more 'normal'
- overall disappointed with execution (more frustrated in cross as out of final on penalty) 
- was difficult for her seeing Finn win (though she was outwardly supportive) as really wanted this experience for herself and her career finale and knew she had the form to be successful
- benefit of excellent post-games plan (holiday, world cup, new job, wedding) will be a protective factor
- end of supportive coach-athlete relationship also factor in to transition support (I have offered to support Mich through his transition)

Finn
- embraced the experience fully and was engaged in all parts of the NZ Team
- Aaron was excellent at keeping Finn relaxed but focused
- was very disappointed to not make final post K1, frustrated it came down to his errors
- took time to process and sit with the disappointment, but switched quickly to cross prep and delivery - did an excellent job of resetting and built into the cross comp superbly
- dominated cross event - stayed very focused throughout but again soaked it all in and was relaxed
- disbelief at win - but delivered really well in post-comp interviews, staying true to his values and acknowledging who and what was important to him.
- challenge will be bringing him back down to earth as the attention he is receiving is quite overwhelming
- he is remaining in the village till the end so will have time to reflect and reset with him once he has a bit of space
- he has verbalised an intention to go for LA

Spent 2-3 days isolated from people, didnt go out for whole day and just felt anxious
plan to go out today as have a little more energy

noticed judging self for not feeling better more at this stage

Managing questions from others
- Bev (probably bc they know the connection) - so can be a bit more specific
- Football/media re: drone - play it down 
- olympics - had a full range of experience

Current state
- sleep poor
- some energy to get out today 

Wellbeing plan for next 3-4 weeks
- share with me and Sarah

Sarah
- use wellbeing plan to guide work
- recap on key events but more importantly emotional impact (anger, anxiety, guilt, shame) and impact on functioning, strategies used to manage but keep developing strategies (mindfulness to be present with emotions, emotional regulation, thought regulation)","2024-08-07_NLawrence_psychology_[notes or letter or screening][optional:_ENCRYPTED]","","4e41f1e3-e4f0-4cdb-91ac-5524f8b854ab","82c8dedd-2456-426b-8df0-3ecc686cc78e"

- do not know if I care enough (not in space to be an advocate/leader/challenger)

opened up a big dialogue about NZOC not caring for people, more about medals, feeing disconnected, manaaki is bullshit, linked to harsh selection criteria 

ASKED him to think about how will this impact how i engage with NZOC moving forward (collecting baggage)

then went on to being challenged in life after full on period
- lived with GF (8 yrs)
- broke up with her as felt was holding her back
- toured USA
- left for Europe for 4 months

new coach is intense/rigid coach - will need to work hard to stay me 

Hold self-steady in the drama
- do bits of my own (nature, laptop, grounding, new things creative and social)

Need to get serious about it
- show up as me
- reduce pressure on self

what are the signs i am overdoing it or avoiding 
- need circuit breakers (people and stimulus like motivational videos)
- energy management 

I have just run out of steam with the struggle

role of therapy?
- think/feel/be messy
- reflect
- keep figuring it out
- look at how past links to the now

We spoke about Villa (club) being an environment that held up a mirror to her vulnerabilities (ego, lack of authenticity, comparison with others) and if she could somehow deprioritise villa and prioritise her MH work then maybe the environment as it is would be less likely to lead to feeling so incsecure.

Checked on SSRI meds impact and she believed she had started to feel a positive difference but didnt know if this was just placebo.
