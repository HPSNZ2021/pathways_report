I am making sure to write some ‘transition of care’ letters to wellbeing providers of athletes who were under the responsibility of NZOC during the games. This letter is in regards to the CRNZ Women’s Squad.  This is excluding Lisa, who I have sent an individual letter to DG. 

While the team has only just completed their Olympic Campaign, they officially leave the responsibility of NZOC on the 12th August. 
 
In summary, none of the team presented to us with any issues in regards to his wellbeing or mental health.  So that is a good thing!  While this does not mean that there wasn’t anything going on, nothing was brought to the attention to me or any member of our psychology team.  

Hannah it was great to see you at the event the other day.  Sarah, thank you so much for keeping me up to date with the squad, and your pre-brief leading into the games.  I’m sure, had I needed it, this would have been very valuable to be connected to a trusted colleague. 
  
While I am sure you are across it, please consider what post-Games support is required for them. Unfortunately some athletes do experience post Games blues, regardless of their performance.  While I am not indicating that the team will experience this, it is important for someone to check in with them around their wellbeing.  I would recommend the plan was discussed between the two of you prior to departure, and is due to be rolled out, depending on what each individual required. 

Points to consider in terms of my observations with the team(s): 

Some further observations is that the environment looked to be quite a “tension zone”.  Sarah, I indicated to you some stuff that was going on, but it was evident some of the tension was coming beyond what you and I discussed.  This was definitely more from management than the athletes.  Athletes were great when I visited them at their accommodation.  Some of this was as the result of being scared of getting COVID and having a poor process around outside visitors, ever changing schedules, and a new physio.  This was not a women’s programme issue, this was an all CRNZ issue.  I am going to try and send a separate email to Nathan Luce about a campaign review and how we go about this, or how we can be a part of the process.  They need some feedback. 

If you both require anything else, then let me know.  I’d be happy to support; especially while you are tied up with ParaOlympics Sarah.

Two points to consider in terms of my observations with the team(s):

After the K4 win, was Lucy Matehaere was quite distant from the general group.  She didn’t seem to be her usual self here when visiting the village either.  I may be reading into it too much, but she seemed very disconnected.  Previously I have seen her as quite supportive of the group; but I do not have all the recent context and may be making some assumptions.  It may be useful for Sarah to follow up please?  

Some further observations is that the environment looked to be quite a “tension zone”.  Sarah, I indicated to you some stuff that was going on, but it was evident some of the tension was coming beyond what you and I discussed.  This was definitely more from management than the athletes.  Athletes were great when I visited them at their accommodation.

I am making sure to write some ‘transition of care’ letters to wellbeing providers of athletes who were under the responsibility of NZOC during the games. This letter is in regards to Haydon Wilde. Travis, its not normal for me to write direcrly to the HPD, but I am doing this for Hayden as he has no performance psychologist that I am aware of, and unsure of his engagement with HPSNZ Performance Life (PL).  

As you know, Hayden has already exited the NZOC umbrella. 
 
In summary, Hayden himself did not present to us with any issues in regards to his wellbeing or mental health.  So that is a good thing!  While this does not mean that there wasn’t anything going on, nothing was brought to the attention to me or any member of our psychology team. I am however very grateful for the conversation you and I were able to have about some of the triathlon environment.  This allowed me to prepare a bit better for what could have played out. 
  
While I am hopeful you are across it, please consider what post-Games support is required for him. Unfortunately some athletes do experience post Games blues, regardless of their performance.  While I am not indicating that Hayden will experience this, it is important for someone to check in with him around his wellbeing.  Typically this would be a psychologist or athlete life.  You may have a Doctor that is attached to Hayden that me be trusted with this.  

Christine, as PL lead, can you please make sure this is followed up in some shape or form.  I don’t want us to make assumptions he (or any athlete) is Ok and for Hayden to fall through the gaps please.  My recommendation is to liaise with his trusted supports first to work out the best approach.  

Travis, if you or Hayden need any assistance or support after the Games, then please do not hesitate to reach out.  I have also connected with your other triathletes support system individually with a ‘transition letter’ to their psychs and PL people.  So in theory, they should be covered well during this time.

I am continuing to write some transition of care letters to providers of athletes who were under the responsibility of NZOC during the games. This letter is in regards to Dylan McCullogh.  He has already exited the NZOC umbrella.
 
For your information, Dylan himself did not present to us with any issues in regards to his wellbeing or mental health.  While this does not mean that there wasn’t anything going on, nothing was brought to the attention of our psychology team. I am however aware of the issues you let me know about which was excellent, and I was able to have some excellent conversations with John Hellemans and Travis White.  
 
Just to summarise, there was some discord within the triathlon environment that was brought to my awareness.  There was some disagreements amongst coaches regarding selection and training schedules which impacted the pre-camp, there was the stressors of the swimming conditions of the Sien, and also some concerns around illness of one of the athletes prior to the mixed relay.  So maybe some of these things may be worth reflecting with Dylan on.  Especially for understanding how he navigated this external noise so well.
 
While I am sure you are across it, please consider what post-Games support is required for him.  Your expertise and connection with him (and John) will be vital.
 
I am not 100% sure who Dylans Performance Life person is.  If you know, can you please pass this on to them.

Just you and me on this one, but thought I would still write a brief note for us. 

The Canoe boys are all finished up now.  They have just been in here to the Village. They ill stay here for the next couple of days, and then (12/8/2024) they transition out of NZOC care and into HPSNZ/ CRNZ responsibility.

We kept in good contact through the Games with these men, so you are up to date.  But to spell it out, we did not have any mental health, wellbeing issues.  Certainly not that I was aware of.

Some considerations we will need to make with them individually:

-	Max and Kurtis; retiring from the sport - TBC.  How do we exit them well? What is our process? How do we analyse what they need.  I’ll include a larger email about this higher up the chain to CRNZ which I will include you in. 
-	Hamish; transition plan as planned. 
-	Grant; less engaged originally, but he is young, new to HP and will need some support as he transitions to the next cycle. 
-	Zach; unsure if he is finishing, taking a break, or continuing.  We may need to revisit and realign his plan. 

I am mindful of your contract finishing up also, and what you can and cant do to support these men.  If we at least start with a basic check in over the next month when they return. That would be a good start to get an updated picture and plan.

I think that is it for now.  But lets just continue to be aware of what may pop up in terms of post-Olympic emotions.

Just you and me on this one, but thought I would still write a brief note for us. 

The Canoe boys are all finished up now.  They have just been in here to the Village. They ill stay here for the next couple of days, and then (12/8/2024) they transition out of NZOC care and into HPSNZ/ CRNZ responsibility.

We kept in good contact through the Games with these men, so you are up to date.  But to spell it out, we did not have any mental health, wellbeing issues.  Certainly not that I was aware of.

Some considerations we will need to make with them individually:

-	Max and Kurtis; retiring from the sport - TBC.  How do we exit them well? What is our process? How do we analyse what they need.  I’ll include a larger email about this higher up the chain to CRNZ which I will include you in. 
-	Hamish; transition plan as planned. 
-	Grant; less engaged originally, but he is young, new to HP and will need some support as he transitions to the next cycle. 
-	Zach; unsure if he is finishing, taking a break, or continuing.  We may need to revisit and realign his plan. 

I am mindful of your contract finishing up also, and what you can and cant do to support these men.  If we at least start with a basic check in over the next month when they return. That would be a good start to get an updated picture and plan.

I think that is it for now.  But lets just continue to be aware of what may pop up in terms of post-Olympic emotions.

Thanks for all the work you have both put into Leila’s campaign.  Getting a heads up and connecting prior to coming over here was really helpful, and also showed your care and intent for her wellbeing and mental performance. 
 
In regard to Leila, we had no formal connection over here.  We did say hi to each other informally at the welcome, induction and when I went out to the cycling hotel to see another athlete.  But from my perspective, there were no mental health or wellbeing concerns presented to me or any of our psychology team.  While this was the case, we know that some athletes can experience post-games blues regardless of outcomes.
 
So, in saying that, I know she was a bit disappointed with her performance.  This info was provided to me via another athlete (to which she sought peer support the morning after the race which seemed to help).  With Leila being a younger athlete, a MH history, it would be good for you to all connect, and re-align your plans for her over the next month please.  I know I am preaching to the choir with you two here, so just see this as a small reminder for the good work you are already doing with her.   I am also mindful Dani that you may not be continuing for much longer with HPSNZ, so this becomes even more critical for that handover care please.
 
If you do need any assistance, ideas or support please do not hesitate to reach out.
 
I appreciate you both and thanks again for your on-going support through the games!
 
Kindest regards,

I am just writing a ‘transition of care’ letter to those involved in the welfare of athletes as they leave us at NZOC.  This is happening regardless of the athlete’s (in your case Rico Bearman), mental wellbeing status.
 
In Rico’s case our psychology team had no interaction with Rico.  There was nothing flagged to us in terms of mental health, wellbeing or mental performance.  This does not mean that there wasn’t anything, but that nothing came to our attention. I was able to meet him briefly at the welcome, induction (here at the village) and at a site visit I did to their accommodation.   
 
As you both aware, some athletes can experience post-Olympic blues, regardless of their performance outcome.  At the risk of telling you what you already know, I would encourage you both to reconnect and realign post games transition plans.  I am not sure if there is anything specific/ niche set up for while you are away at the Paralympics Lou, but this was the only difference I could identify in Rico’s situation worth considering.
 
Thank you both for being amazing advocates for the wellbeing and performances of Rico (and many other athletes here at the Games).  It was great to see him here at the Village interacting with the other athletes, even though it was only brief. I hope he enjoyed his experience!  
 
If you do need anything, or have additional questions, please do not hesitate to get in contact.  I look forward to seeing you both back in Cambridge.

I’m just writing a very brief transition letter for the athletes, to their sports/ sport leads and wellbeing colleagues when the athletes exit our NZOC care. 
 
I didn’t get to see much of the men’s team in person, in this role.  I visited them in Nice for an NZOC welcoming which was great and was able to be with them when they received their Olympic Pounamu.  I was able to do approximately 6 one v one sessions with players who requested it.  Several players continued to link in with me across the tournament, more so in part of my NZF role, opposed to the NZOC lead psychologist role. This centred around performance and positive work. 

While there were no overt wellbeing issues, there were a couple of injuries and given they were young men, I followed up thanks to coach information and medical staff as part of the processes. Happy with where this is at.  There is nothing obvious for any of you to follow up in this regard.
 
There were no mental health issues from our end, and no other presenting concerns.  

Taylor and Helen, I do think it is important you do a follow up check in with the WPX men and see how they process their experience of the Games.  What did they learn, did they reach their own personal goals, what was tough/ easy and how did they navigate that in order to learn more about themselves as people first, footballers next.  

While everything seems fine on the surface, I do not get to see or hear of everything; but some athletes do experience post-Olympic blues, regardless of their results.  So please follow up any of your players in a collaborative manner.  

Keir and Jacob, I will follow up the other NZF players as part of our process.

I know this is a bit weird me doing both roles, but doing my best to ensure a smooth transition and provide what information I can to assist in the wellbeing of all players, and athletes from the Games. 

If you have any concerns, please contact me.

I visited them in Nice for an NZOC welcoming which was great and was able to be with them when they received their Olympic Pounamu.  I was able to do approximately 6 one v one sessions with players who requested it.  Several players continued to link in with me across the tournament, more so in part of my NZF role, opposed to the NZOC lead psychologist role. This centred around performance and positive work. 

While there were no overt wellbeing issues, there were a couple of injuries and given they were young men, I followed up thanks to coach information and medical staff as part of the processes. Happy with where this is at.  There is nothing obvious for any of you to follow up in this regard.
 
There were no mental health issues from our end, and no other presenting concerns.  

Taylor and Helen, I do think it is important you do a follow up check in with the WPX men and see how they process their experience of the Games.  What did they learn, did they reach their own personal goals, what was tough/ easy and how did they navigate that in order to learn more about themselves as people first, footballers next.  

While everything seems fine on the surface, I do not get to see or hear of everything; but some athletes do experience post-Olympic blues, regardless of their results.  So please follow up any of your players in a collaborative manner.  

Keir and Jacob, I will follow up the other NZF players as part of our process.

I know this is a bit weird me doing both roles, but doing my best to ensure a smooth transition and provide what information I can to assist in the wellbeing of all players, and athletes from the Games. 

If you have any concerns, please contact me.

I’m just writing a very brief transition letter for the athletes, to their sports/ sport leads and wellbeing colleagues when the athletes exit our NZOC care. 
 
I didn’t get to see much of the men’s team in person, in this role.  I visited them in Nice for an NZOC welcoming which was great and was able to be with them when they received their Olympic Pounamu.  I was able to do approximately 6 one v one sessions with players who requested it.  Several players continued to link in with me across the tournament, more so in part of my NZF role, opposed to the NZOC lead psychologist role. This centred around performance and positive work. 

While there were no overt wellbeing issues, there were a couple of injuries and given they were young men, I followed up thanks to coach information and medical staff as part of the processes. Happy with where this is at.  There is nothing obvious for any of you to follow up in this regard.
 
There were no mental health issues from our end, and no other presenting concerns.  

Taylor and Helen, I do think it is important you do a follow up check in with the WPX men and see how they process their experience of the Games.  What did they learn, did they reach their own personal goals, what was tough/ easy and how did they navigate that in order to learn more about themselves as people first, footballers next.  

While everything seems fine on the surface, I do not get to see or hear of everything; but some athletes do experience post-Olympic blues, regardless of their results.  So please follow up any of your players in a collaborative manner.  

Keir and Jacob, I will follow up the other NZF players as part of our process.

I know this is a bit weird me doing both roles, but doing my best to ensure a smooth transition and provide what information I can to assist in the wellbeing of all players, and athletes from the Games. 

If you have any concerns, please contact me.

I’m just writing a very brief transition letter for each of the athletes and sport leads when they exit our care. 
 
It was great to meet Lulu and Erin, and excellent to see them getting involved in our wider NZ team.  I especially enjoyed a couple of catch ups with them (and Neil) as we all shared an apartment in the Village.  They brought a real fun energy each day which was well received and they met a lot of new athletes from our team. 
 
There were no wellbeing issues from our end, and no presenting concerns.  Erin came across as a very confident, bubbly person, and Lulu seemed a very resilient individual. While they move on to the next tournament, it is not uncommon for athletes (and coaches) to experience some post Games blues, regardless of their results.  So if you are concerned about wither Erin or Lulu at any point in your check ins or reviews, please do not hesitate to get in contact. However, I know Jason you are well across their progress. 

Neil was also an excellent addition to the NZ team as well.  He was my room buddy.  I thoroughly enjoyed his insights.  Again, he seems like an old hand, but if you do require any extra assistance or have questions on support, then Id happily support your current processes. 

Thanks again.

I’m just writing a very brief transition of care letter for each of the athletes to their psychs, PL and any other relevant people, when the athletes exit our care. 
 
I had the pleasure of going out to Equestrian a couple of days before they started. We did a welcome and I got to meet the athletes.  While it was only brief, it was a great experience. 
 
After this the psychology team from NZOC did not hear from any of the Equestrian athletes or support staff.  I did not hear of any concerns or other environmental issues.  This does not mean these were non-existent, but certainly were not to our knowledge. Hopefully they connected with you both, or your job was done so well prior that they were reasonably self-sufficient. 

As you both know, regardless of results people can experience post pinnacle event blues. So if you do notice this in any athletes or support staff, and need any assistance, my door is open to discuss.  However, I have full faith in you guys to support what is needed.  

I do not have any further recommendations to make, but as you both know, Pathways workshop later in the year may be something worth considering for your athletes.

Hi Carolyn and Andrea
 
I’m just writing a very brief transition letter for each of the athletes and sport leads when they exit our care.
 
It was great to meet Georgia-Rose, and excellent to see her getting involved in out wider NZ team.  I especially enjoyed a couple of catch ups with her, and loved being able to go and watch her event.
 
There were no wellbeing issues from our end, and no presenting concerns.  While Georgia-Rose came across as a very confident and resilient individual, it is not uncommon for athletes (and coaches) to experience some post Games blues, regardless of their results.  So if you are concerned about Georgia-Rose at any point, please do not hesitate to get in contact.
 
Kind regards,

I’m just writing a very brief transition of care letter for each of the athletes and sport leads when they exit our care.
 
It was great to meet Maddie.  She spent and good amount of time in the athlete lounge and genuinely looked happy to be here around the other athletes.  It was great to witness.
 
There were no wellbeing issues from our end with Maddie, and no presenting concerns.  As you both know, it is not uncommon for athletes (and coaches) to experience some post Games blues, regardless of their results.  So if you are concerned about Maddie at any point, please do not hesitate to get in contact.  
 
I have full confidence in your support team, and given your long standing relationship with Maddie, Jason, I also wanted to say what a tremendous job you have done.
 
What I would perhaps suggest is someone connect with Alex, Maddie’s coach at some point.  He had to double up on support for Dylan as well and while he didn’t really connect with any of us, a brief conversation with him did perhaps show some stressors.  I understand he has two young kids at home, and his wife was ‘holding the fort’ back there with little other family support. While I don’t think it is anything of great concern, I think it would be good to check in, and review the campaign with him.  
 
Thank you all!
 
Kind regards,

Hey DG and Tiff.
 
I just wanted to send a note to say the 7s men have left the village now. Despite the unfortunate result and no doubt some hurt, the men absolutely held themselves in high regard here at the games. 
 
They were excellent to have around the village, and many of the other athletes here really valued being in their presence. 
 
From a psychology perspective, none of the men presented with any mental health, wellbeing or performance issues to our NZOC team.
 
I'm sure there are a few bumps and bruises (physically and mentally). However, this is just a note to handover to you both and say no concerns presented here. 
 
I hope they are able to enjoy some time off, and you guys are able to implement any of the post-games well-being plans built prior. 
 
While I'm overseas, if you need any extra support from NZR, Nathan Price will be the best person to implement and action items. I'm still happy to consult from afar though. 
 
Thanks again for being a special part of these men and management lives. It was a privilege to be amongst their performances and presence as always!

Lizzie wanted to discuss her relationship with her father.  He is messaging her close to her event and it is causing her to lose focus. She gets upset and feels sorry for him (she disclosed his troubles with alcohol).  Lizzie noted that she was tearful this morning which often does not happen. 
Lizzie also noted that her husband is becoming jeleous of her Olympic experience and having to look after their daughter. 
We discussed some on going work around boundaries with her father, and explored how she can ""block"" or silence"" his messages during the Olympics, while doing this in a way that is kind but assertive. 
We also noted how having a focus each day on her perofmacne routines and reflections and gratitude can help her stay focussed on the job at hand, rather than spending time focussed on her relationship with her father.  However noting that this is something that she needs to approach in the future. 

Plan:
- Stay in contact, allowing Lizzie the space to download her concerns.

James self referred via the QR code.  He noted that he normally connects with John Quinn and Campbell Thompson.  The presenting issue was around his achilles injury and worrying about how it will stop him perfomancing.  Previous skills provided by mental skills have been breathing exercise and body scan.  We discussed the use of thought challenging as an added skill given there was some irrational and unhelpful thinking around his injury.  I followed this up with a whattasapp as to how he can challenge his thoughts along with a video.  We also discussed how he is avoiding doing the simple things that will be impacting his overall anxiety and therefore causing him to focus more on his sore achilles. 

Plan:
Check back in a few days prior to racing.

Location: Paris Village

Presentation: Niamh engaged well but presented as anxious.  She often shook in the session, and mumbled her words at times.  However, she was open and transparent and rapport was established relatively easily.  

Current situation:  Referral came to me from Dr Sarah Beable.  Concerned about her sleep, anxiety and eating behaviours. Niamh lives in Spain, outside of NZ and has not had previous psychology input. Her father helps out the NZ cycle team and is currently here with them (which she noted she did not like).  Niamh has difficulties with sleep and nerves prior to race day.  However her sleep is normally ""good"" the night before a race.  Primarily she has difficulty with her sleep maintenance. Niamh takes Tamazapam (check spelling).

Session content:
- Niamh noted that she moved house almost monthly as a child which was concerning. 
- I provided a breif formulation and psychology-education of sleep and what can help. 
- We looked at her next two days before she raced and put down some controllable actions to help her reduce ""what if"" thoughts. 
- Discussed a basic ""worry journal concept"". 
- Eating seemed more to be related to anxiety of racing more than disordered eating.  However, this was not explored in the current session.  Worth following up given weight, issues with controllability and relationship to food. 

Plan:
- Niamh to action the above.
-Discussion of future actions for psychology input for Niamh - e.g sleep psychology and possible referral to eating specialist.","2024-08-04_NFisher-Black_psychology_[notes or letter or screening][optional:_ENCRYPTED]","","dce9f6d5-4529-4ecb-bd3b-96e21c536444","78f5021d-e484-4192-b6d2-a858f5b62e1b"

Location: CNZ hotel. 

Presentation: Rebecca presented as confident, clear in her processes and self reported excitement.  She didn't look tired like she normally does.  She reported some sore stomach prior but noted that she believes this is more due to adapting to food. 

Context:  There was some concern from physio that her sore stomach was connected to being nervous.  However Rebecca and her doctor have both said this is not the case.  I would agree given Rebeccas presentation and voice.  I have some concern over the environmental stressors and tension within the group being projected on to Rebeccas case. 

Session content:
- Reflected on key psychological skills and use of these. 
- Noted focus for the next few days and mindset entering this final stage to competition. 
- Acknowledged external noise from environment and pressure; however Rebecca very clear on her process. 

Plan:
- No further engagement prior to racing unless required. 
- See Rebecca post race for debrief headed into her final event.

Presentation: Zach was more engaged than usual.  He expressed some vulnerability and noted his inability to stay present and relaxed (i.e. thinking too far ahead). Zach seemed down and frustrated at the beginning of the session, but as the session went on he relaxed and become more solution focussed. 

Session content:  
- Discussed current situation.  That being he was finding it difficult to find motivation after being sick and noticing he was feeling a removed from the team due to them coming into the village and now competing. 
- We worked through what he has done to contribute to the team in the lead up as a reserve.  
- Discussed ways to find more internal motivation and then planning his time in Paris while he is not part of the competition. 

Plan:
- Connect with Zach in a weeks time to see how he is doing. 
- Zach to talk to family and friend Taylor Reid to build a plan outside of the competition. 
- Zach to follow up with HPD around a guest pass after Olympics comp.

Presentation:  Lizzie initiated the session and was engaged and motivated to connect.  Rapport was established quickly and she was transparent about her past.  There was no observable anxiety, however her tone of voice stays fairly consistent through a conversation.  It does not rise much when she is talking about something exciting, nor does it drop when she is discussing an emotional topic. 

Current circumstances:  Lizzie is married and has a daughter Athena who is two and a half years-old.  She lives in America and has a degree in psychology, and is about to embark on a law degree alongside diving. 

Session content:
- Introductions and connections. 
- Awareness of consent and confidentiality. 
- Discussed performance psychology models that may work and resonate with her. In particular setting a focus for training around her values, and then provided MILC framework for reflection.  Importantly this was to help build and strengthen her relationship with her coach (this is a new coach-athlete relationship).  
- Lizzie also requested for her daughter to come into the village.  I have followed this up, but was told this is unlikely to happen.  It was going to be followed up with Chef de Mission and or Team Services Manager.  Lizzie was based on this feedback. 

Plan:
- Connect informally when she requests.  There is no further follow ups planned, although Lizzie indicated that she would like another session before competition.

Location: BMX Hotel.

People: Dom Vettise (me) and Dr Sarah Beable met with her together. 

Presentation: Samara (Sammie preferred name) was bubbly and energetic.  There seemed to be a lot of impression management playing out given the situation and circumstances surrounding her in the lead up to the Olympics.  Sammie tends to call each of us ""mate"" and tends to be overly friendly.  At times this way of interacting with us lended itself to interpret that her emotional maturity seemed significantly younger than her chronological age.  

After first meeting with us upon arrival, she then went to get changed for training.  Upon coming out of the hotel room she appeared to have been crying, then quickly switched into an overly friendly manner ""everything is awesome. Training will be amazing"".  While we were there to do a wellbeing check and introduce ourselves, when I asked where her supports were and what were they doing for her, she started to say ""do you mean for performance of for my eating disord...."" then stopped and corrected to wellbeing.  A lot of the conversation was very surface level and came across as pre planned.  

Sammie dominated and controlled the topic of conversation and quickly switched through a. number of topics.  Her speech is very fast throughout. Sammie uses humour a lot in her conversation.  This did not seem congruent to the topic we were discussing. Despite this, she engaged well, and rapport was easily established, however given the above scepticism through incongruence of speech, behaviour and context, I am unclear that rapport was genuine. 

Current circumstances:  Sammie is competing at the Olympics in MTB.  She has had some previous treatment of an eating disorder which has caused some debate and tribunals around her selection.  This was widely publicised.  Dr Sarah and I used this as an opportunity to connect with her, do a basic wellbeing check and let her know where her key supports were within NZOC. 

Session content:
- Introduction and connection. 
- Discussed wellbeing and how she had been post the tribunal and what her current support system is. 

Plan:
- Sammie said she will contact us if she needs anything, rather than us reaching out to her. 
- While I believe she will be OK during the Olympics, I have concerns about her long-term wellbeing and mental health should she continue in the sport, without appropriate support and finishing therapy started in New Zealand. 
- I am unsure what the role of NZOC is at this point and how we highlight concerns observed.","2024-07-30_SMaxwell_psychology_[notes or letter or screening][optional:_ENCRYPTED]","","3c5be126-8886-41c9-8beb-ae8101280f16","ed126c98-1ebb-4f5f-ac0b-01a11ae0592f"

Presentation:  Finn was very relaxed and engaged in the session.  Rapport is high because of our long term therapeutic relationship. 

Risk; No risk disclosed. 

Session Content:
- Discussed his recent transfer to the United States and how he is managing the situation. 
- Discussed leadership qualities reflected on from the previous tour. 
- Set new goals and challenges for his leadership both on and off the field. 
- Finn is aiming to facilitate conversation more. 
- We also discussed his complexities of showing leadership when he is captain versus not captain.  In particular enjoying responsibility and wanting to take the pressure off others.  We noted that Finn at times feels he needs ""permission"" to be a leader and gets that through captaincy.  Opposed to being a leader of self, others and team regardless of an arm band.

In Person - Nice Hotel

Presentation:  Ben is an excellent engager, takes notes and asks questions.  He is very positive, open to learning and we have an excellent therapeutic relationship. 

Risk: None

Session content:
- Discussed his current mindset plan for the Olympics. 
- Discussed honing in his sniper mindset and reflections; . 
- Noted how important his reflections will be. 
- Set goals and converse via email after.

S – Specific; are they really clear.
M- Measurable; how can you measure these and how do you know if you are on track.
A – Achievable…Im not sure I like this one, but they need to push you…is it too comfortable zone, in stretch zone (where you want to be), or breaking zone,  just too hard.
R- Realistic
T – Timely (i.e. can they be achieved by the time the Olympics end, or have you put a time you want to achieve them by.
 
So my thoughts as a result of the above…
 
Performance Goals:
Score 3 goals in group stage
    Is this in your comfort, stretch or breaking zone.
Win a medal
    Cool and fun.  Any type of medal, and again what zone is this in? You can use this as a visualising experience also. Visualise winning the medal and receiving it.  A good one if you notice yourself getting flat.
Process goals:
    Be inquisitive, ask questions daily!
    Be more specific with this. Is there anything in particular you want to ask about in order to improve your play?  Or is this simply in an effort to show courage, and or to show personal leadership (aka work on leadership skills).
    I’m essentially trying to get you to connect to WHY you want to do this. How does it fit into your overall plan for 2026.
“Win the next moment” & “Sniper mindset”
    What would success look like here?  What are two or three things you would notice in training or in a game that would tell you you are on track!
    How are you rating how well you do this?
Embrace the responsibility
    Again, what does this look like?  How would you know you are achieving this?

In Person; at the Hotel in Nice. 

Presentation; Riley engaged well but was monotone in voice and had limited eye contact through the session.  His mood was low, but this is congruent to his current situation.  As the session moved on he became more open minded and was respondent to solution focussed work.

Risk; No risk currently.  However being mindful of risk factors present ie. Current injury, two recent injuries, recent relocation to America (2 months ago), young player, soon to exit Olympics.

Current situation and session content:
- Riley suffered a hamstring injury in lead up to Olympics. 
- According to medical a minimal of two weeks out; currently deciding if he heads home or stays on. 
- Riley feeling hopeless about the situation, maintained by thoughts of wanting to have the Olympics as a stepping stone to kick start his career. 
- We discussed that his current emotions are normal, but if still present in 3-4 weeks time then we require another check in. 
- Strategies included him thinking about how he can look back on his time with football at the Olympics and enjoy the moment, rather than it being solely about his injury. Riley responded well to this. 
- Update provided to coach and Doctor. Strategies and recommendations also made.  See below message to coach:


""Hey Baze. Re Riley. He is doing ok and going through all the normal emotions given the context. There are two things that will be most helpful are:
1.⁠ ⁠Allowing him the time to connect with his family when they are here. Really noting that he shouldn’t feel guilty for missing a training or something to be with them. It may even be great for you to meet with them and grab a coffee with them. Just the connection and be kiwi piece. 
2.⁠ ⁠⁠Try and provide as much clarity as possible with what he is doing (staying, going, how many days). I’m sure this is unclear at the moment for you and medical but even letting him know it’s unclear and including him in that decision making process where possible. This will really help him to take ownership of his emotions and mindset moving forward! 

The reality is he is quite low in mood. But it’s freash and normal. The danger is he has a lot of life stressors over the past few months so we need to help him feel some form of controllability in this situation. 

Plan:
- Reconnect with Riley in a week. 
- Stay connected to medical staff.","2024-07-23_RBidois_psychology_[notes or letter or screening][optional:_ENCRYPTED]","","592cf6ea-f145-4955-b750-1fef213d0449","5c39a336-a59b-47d2-a54a-4907db3e3bc6"

Location; In Person, Hotel in Nice

Presentation; Engaged well in the session with excellent eye contact and openness to be transparent about previous tour struggles.  Very relaxed posture and rapport developed easily. 

Risk: No risk disclosed. 

Current situation and session content:

- Discussed with Oskar his previous tour, how that was handled, and what he learned from it. 
- Discussed work previously conducted and on going with Wellington Phoenix psychologist. 
- Covered how he could begin to shift and challenge himself to build trust with other team members but also allow him to look after his own wellbeing by giving himself space.  Opposed to looking disinterested in team culture. 
- Consent to pass on to the Wellington Phoenix Psych was given to me from Oskar. 

Plan:
- Pass on information to Wellington Phoenix Psychologist (Taylor Noble). 
- Oskar continues to work with Taylor.
- Check in on Oskar post tour.","2024-07-23_Ovan Hattum_psychology_[notes or letter or screening][optional:_ENCRYPTED]","","e8654696-3a4e-4e30-9709-974af77287f8","9b2298ee-793f-49d6-8bde-f825a69728dd"

Attended - Anna Leat; Kylie Wilson; Dr COLLEEN WINSTANLEY, Dom.

Presentation:  Anna engaged well in the meeting. He mood was congruent with the context.  While she became visibly upset, she was presented as comfortable in the session, disclosed her thoughts freely and added humour into the conversation.  Anna has excellent rapport with Kylie and Colleen. 

Risk:  No disclosed risk or suicidal ideation. 

Session content:
- Anna, Dr Colleen and Kylie wanted my opinion on a treatment plan for Anna. 
- Anna has a long history of mental illness; mainly depression and anxiety.  She has previously seen me when she lived in New Zealand and intermittently went she transitioned to Georgetown University. 
- Anna was recently seen by a psychiatrist in London, connected to Aston Villa Football club.  The Psychiatrist diagnosed her with anxiety, ADHD and some subclinical OCD.  The doctors recommendations were Sertraline and ADHD medicine, alongside talking therapy. Anna is reluctant to use medicine due to certain beliefs (i.e. ""Its the easy way to get better""). 
- Without telling Anna what to do I helped her to understand the pros and cons of medicine; and how it may help her long history of mental ill health.  
- Anna spoke about how medicine has helped her father significantly. This makes Anna sad was she saw him change (for the better), and is struggling to let go of her old self. 
- Annastaed that she would like to start Sertraline and hold off on the ADHD medicine. 
- We made a plan for what support for this looks like across the Olympics; especially given that it may drop her mood more at the Games. 

Plan:
- Start medicine - Dr Colleen across this. 
- Kylie to continue to connect regularly focussed on wellbeing check in and perofmance mindset. 
- Dom to do a follow up in a weeks time. 
- Post Games ; Dom, Kylie, Dr Colleen and Anna to meet with Aston Villa Psychiatrist and formulate a transition plan and clarify roles.

Presentation:  Macey was engaged in todays session.  Her mood seemed to have lifted from previous session as there wa less negative thinking present, more smiling.  Rapport has built strongly as she disclosed some sensitive information. She is agreeable in this session and needs to be reminded to challenge and push back on things opinions and hypotheses she disagrees with.  Macey was oriented to person, place and time.  

Risk:  Macey reported that she has not had any suicidal ideation since our first meeting.  He risk is still considered as moderate low.


Session content:
- Read back her formulation. Maeys feedback was that this made a lot of sense to her. 
- Macey disclosed sexual assault from a cousin.  She was 7 years old and the cousin was 11 years old (approximately.  She only disclosed this to her parents last year.  Macey noted that she had spoken to her previous psychologist about it but did not want to continue with specialist complex trauma work.  I have recommended to Macey that this would be helpful to reconsider at some point.  The extend of the sexual assault is unknown.  However it does have some impact on sexual functioning with her current boyfriend.  Again she did not disclose the extent yet. I have said I would add this to her formulation to help best inform her psychologist back in Utah. 
- Basic CBT framework introduced.
- Used current working examples to help her understand how the formulation ties together. 
- Implement reflection and thought challenging skills to help her regulate her emotions more. 

Plan:
- See Macey in 3 days time. She is to practice the new CBT structure in  her journaling.

We looked at some reflection of the current training schedule from a mind perspective.  All kayakers were asked to rate mental preparedness and provide rational.  There was some challenge from each other, and questions asked. But generally they were all aligned with how each other was feeling and thinking. 

Clear focuses on having clarity, connecting back to their performance plans, and debriefs are working well. Common language were finding the smallest things in each day to fill their confidence buckets and continuous learning.


Home work tasks were to come up with 4 ""what if"" scenarios each and work through as a group to find solutions.  In addition they were to think about what success would look like (psychologically, physically, technically), by two days out of race day.

In person at NZOC Building. 

In the morning Harley presented with anxiety and physiological symptoms of shallow breathing and sweating.  He commented that he was having an anxiety attack. 

Harley went to his room to deescalate his anxiety.  He was brought food and water to help nourish him as he had been working very hard in his role.  It seemed that he was triggered by a lot of unpredictable and uncontrollable scenarios that are panning out here.  He has an oversees of responsibility and has been working hard to ""prove himself"" to others. 

In the afternoon I visited Harley to get a better understanding of what had occurred and the support he has.  

There was no risk to self, or others.  He has a history of mental ill health with anxiety and low mood; mainly perpetual by feeling isolated and different to others.  Harley is seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist back home.  He has access to SSRIs (reported by Dr Sarah Beable), but has not started taking these.  Dr Sarah recommended it would not be helpful to start these while at the Games and Harley agreed. 

I provided some basic CBT psych education and some strategies around challenging his unhelpful thinking that seems to be escalating his anxiety response in a pressured and tense environment (e.g. deliveries are not coming into the village and he feels its his responsibility to organise this).  I also helped focus his journey writing into something more beneficial for him. 

His anxiety attack was visible to most in the NZOC team so they have been asking how to support.  I have focussed on aligning his immediate reporting line to streamline his work so he still feels included, but not to the point of being overwhelmed.  Doctor Bruce and Sarah are aware and have checked in on him.  His wellbeing buddy (Alexis) is also aware.  There is a clear plan for Harley to return to work with graded exposure to workload over the next couple of days. 

I will check on him again tomorrow.

Presentation: Macey engaged well in the session.  Her mood was more stable and there was less upsetness in todays session. 

Risk: There was no disclosure if risk to self today.  Suicidal ideation from the previous two nights had subsided and intent had dropped to 0/10. Risk remains at low-moderate.  Team doctor updated and informed. 

Session content:  Today we delved more into her background growing up.  Macey stated that her Dad was not physically available at home.  He often worked late and then in the weekends spent a lot of time with her older brothers at football.  It was her mother that took her to football trainings and football games.  However Macey reported that her mother never spoke to her in the car rides and was often confused as to whether her mother cared for her at all.  Macey stated that she often felt confused in this regard.  Her father was more emotionally available, but not physically present.  This would have impacted her ability to learn how to express and receive emotion.  In addition, she noted that she envied (and still does), her brothers as they received all the attention and wondered why she was treated differently. 

This continued through school where she felt like her parents had minimal boundaries for her, and felt like they didn't really care what she did with her life. While Macey enjoyed Primary and Intermediate school, she often became anxious about making sure she did what was right in order to not get in trouble and have approval from her parents. 

Macey reported that when she moved to Wellington Phoenix her Mum and her became more close.  However on the trip that her mother took to come watch Macey play, she reported that she got sent off.  After the game she was upset because of the red card and her mother asked her to take a photo together. Macey declined a phot because of being upset and also wanted to return to the changing room to look more presentable for a photo.  On returning from the changing rooms her mother left and flew back to Christchurch without talking to Macey. 

There are several instances in Macey's life where she feels as if she has been let down by her parents and has developed a sense of independence to look after herself in order to not get hurt. This has likely led to introversion, difficulties with trust, misinterpretation of others responses to her and poor/ limited emotion regulation skills. As such, she experiences significant distress in social situation where she perceives that others may not care for her if she does something wrong, not acceptable and or misses out on belonging. 

Plan:
- Update and report to those consented to (e.g. Dr Colleen and Kylie Wilson).
- Send a plan and recommendations for treatment both at the Olympic Games and post Games.
- See Macey on 17.7.2024 to build a more updated wellbeing plan.

Referral came from Doctor Colleen (NZF) and Kylie Wilson (NZF Mental Skills).

Presenting problem; concern for risk of self to which she had text her boyfriend that she no longer wished to be here anymore.  Macey also experiences low mood (likelihood of depression, and social anxiety).   

Presentation: Macey was very tearful across the session precipitated by being embarrassed for where she is at despite living her dreams.  She found it very difficult to talk about suicide related topics.  Despite this Macey was engaged and self reported motivation to get better.  Macey was orientated to person place and time. 

Risk:  Macey had been experiencing suicidal ideation.  However there was no current plan, and her intention to follow through with her thoughts sat at 4/10 (10= that she will definitely follow through with it). Macey has a history of three suicide attempts (pills and 2x driving incidents), with the last two attempts occurring in December 2023 and January 2024.  She was taken to hospital after her last attempt (pills), but did not seek care after. It is considered that her current risk to self is sitting at low-moderate risk. Her recent suicidal ideation was triggered by some unhelpful thoughts in regards to her relationship (e.g. ""my boyfiriend doesn't love me"", and a note from her teammates saying she was due for her initiation tonight). 

In regards to risk management both Kylie and Dr Colleen have been updated on the situation.  Macey gave verbal consent to pass on information in order to coordinate her care.  At this point the plan is that she is safe to stay in camp with the Football Ferns, and tomorrow (16.7.2024), will be a second opportunity to see Macey and build a more accurate safety and wellbeing plan for her. There ill then be ongoing discussion as to her treatment plan post Olympics. 

Session content notes: Macey is from Christchurch, and is 22 years old.  She was with the Wellington Phoenix for two years before recently making the transition to Utah for her professional career in April 2024.  This came with a quick rise to ""fame"" and a lot of media attention in New Zealand. 

Macey has two older brothers and her parents are still together in Christchurch.  She has always had dreams of being a professional footballer.  Macey has developed some ritualistic behaviours in the last two years which she believes were the key to her success.  e.g. Run first thing in the morning, clean room, needs to always know a plan, sleep routines; she calls this her ""OCD"".  When she does these, she ""loves this person more"".  However, these rigid beliefs in other ways are likely contributing to her low mood and anxiety (social).

Macey reported that her emotions switch very fast and she does not know why.  There seems to be some intolerance of uncertainty and need to control her emotions.  She stated that she can be very self conscious in some contexts, but others not.  Macey is confident in her ability to deal with stress on the football pitch, but not confident in her coping skills around her emotions off the pitch. She felt ""embarrassed and ridiculous"" when talking about her emotions and reported lying and avoiding psychologists who try to help her around her low mood.  Macey reported to struggle with trusting people, and did have fears of being ""alone"". 

Plan:  
1. Connect with Kylie and Dr. Colleen to pass on plan.
2. Follow up with Macey on 17th; follow up questions, psychometrics and background information.
3. Build a more comprehensive safety plan.
